# Instructional Design Portfolio

**Evidence-Based Learning Design | AI Integration | Educational Technology**

Welcome! This portfolio showcases my work at the intersection of instructional design, educational technology, and responsible AI adoption in learning environments. With a doctorate in education and 15+ years of experience, I specialize in transforming complex concepts into engaging, effective learning experiences.

---

## 🎯 What I Do

I design learning experiences that:
- **Bridge theory and practice** - Translating research in cognitive science, learning theory, and AI into actionable instructional strategies
- **Leverage emerging technologies responsibly** - Integrating AI, adaptive learning systems, and educational technology with strong ethical frameworks
- **Scale effectively** - Creating frameworks and programs that serve diverse learner populations across institutional contexts
- **Drive measurable outcomes** - Aligning learning objectives with organizational goals and evidence-based assessment

## 🧠 Instructional Design Philosophy

My approach is grounded in three core principles:

**1. Learner-Centered Design**  
Every design decision starts with understanding learner needs, prior knowledge, and goals. I use backward design, begin with clear learning outcomes, and design assessments and instruction that authentically measure those outcomes.

**2. Evidence-Based Practice**  
I ground my work in cognitive science, learning theory research, and data from pilot implementations. My designs incorporate principles of cognitive load theory, spaced repetition, retrieval practice, and multimedia learning.

**3. Ethical Technology Integration**  
As AI and educational technology evolve, I prioritize transparency, accessibility, privacy, and alignment with human values. I advocate for responsible adoption frameworks that empower rather than replace human expertise.
