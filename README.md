# Neria Sebastien, Ed.D.

**AI Safety & Learning Strategy Leader | Educational Technology | AI Governance & Ethics**

I lead AI integration initiatives in medical education at Columbia University Irving Medical Center, where I chair the AI Community of Practice (140+ faculty), serve on institutional governance committees (ETAC, ERC), and develop comprehensive AI literacy programs for faculty and learners.

My work bridges technical AI concepts with practical implementation in high-stakes educational environments, focusing on responsible adoption, interpretability, and alignment with human values.
